var frisbee = "I had a new friendship, about a year or two old, and she and I were driving in the car and I said, My friend's brother ran for mayor of Los Angeles. She looked surprised. Then she said, MY friend's brother ran for mayor of Los Angeles too! we then realized that we had the same friend, whose brother ran for the mayor of Los Angeles several years ago.";
        
var flirtFriends = "Twenty years ago I met someone at my cousins' wedding. We flirted, and we saw each other once or twice after that. About 5 years ago he friended me on Facebook, but I hadn't seen him in 15 years and we didn't actually talk on FB. Then last year, he messaged me on Facebook saying he was coming to my city for a few days for a conference and would I like to get together. I said I was flying out that day, but maybe we could see each other at the airport depending on the timing. Turns out he was getting off of the same plane I was boarding.";

var clock = "I am retired, so I don't need to get up at a fixed time. Mostly, I go to bed after 4 o'clock in the morning, but it's always at a different time. I don't have an alarm clock, so the next day I usually wake up after 7 to 8 hours of sleeping. When I wake up, I look at a digital clock. Very often it reads 14:14, sometimes it reads 15:15. Note that I did NOT develop the habit of waking up at 14:14 from earlier years. Sometimes this happens 4 to 5 times during one week. What are the chances...?";

var imagine = "My dad died in August 1997 and was a big Beatles and John Lennon fan. I thought that it would be a nice idea to have the word 'imagine' on his plaque as a reference to the song and how life could have been different for my dad. In September I was discussing this idea with my sister on the phone when suddenly she stopped and said that the song 'Imagine' had just come on the radio.";

var age = "I have recently noticed a lot of coincidences in my life between age and date. Where the same numbers occur in my age to the numbers that occur in the date of the year, it seems there is a significant change to my life soon after. In 1961 I turned 16 and met my future husband. We didn't have much to do with each other until we met again in 1971. We decided to marry in 1972 when I was 27. The date of our marriage was the 27th January 1973. On this date my father's age was 65 years 10 months and my mother's age was 62 years 9 months.";

var house = "We'd traveled to Stockholm to join a cruise ship sailing round the Baltic Chat between fellow passengers is the norm on cruises. We live in Bolton in the north west and struck up a conversation with a couple who live in the New Forest. No real coincidence here as half the passengers were British. However this couple from the New Forest used to live in the house we currently live in up here in Bolton. Not nearby but the exact same house. So, we're on a ship in the Baltic Sea and meet the people who used to live in our house. Awesome as the Americans might say.";

var mars = "Roughly fifty years ago I took the back off our valve radio and I removed and cleaned the dust off the valves and the rest of the chassis etc. When I put the valves back in and was about to switch it on either my mother or myself said maybe we will get a message from Mars now. When I switched the radio on the first words from the speaker were 'Mars calling, Mars calling'. My mother and I were speechless. I do not expect anyone to actually believe this but it did happen.";

var abbieMike = "In 1984, my friend - Kenny Mundie - and I were colleagues who worked night shift. One afternoon, Kenny picked me up and we drove into town. As we drove, Kenny mentioned a friend of his called Abbie Copeland whom he was convinced I must know. I said I didn't know Abbie, but I mentioned that I had heard of him from a friend of mine called Mike Geddes. Kenny said that he didn't know Mike, but I was adamant that he must know Mike. We were still debating the matter when we stopped behind a Ford Transit van at a set of traffic lights. As we waited for the lights to turn green, I looked to my left and Mike Geddes walked into view. I pointed towards Mike and said to Kenny, 'That's Mike Geddes!' Before I could attract Mike's attention, he walked up to the van in front of us, opened the passenger door and climbed into the passenger seat. The van driver turned to greet Mike, giving both of us a clear view of his face for the first time. Kenny pointed at the van driver and exclaimed, 'And that is Abbie Copeland!' I would love to know what the odds are of this chance encounter.";

var win = "My wallet was stolen from my University office shortly after my mother had died. Inside was her old bank card with a slip of paper with her PIN number, yes very silly I know. The thief withdrew the remaining balance of £57 at a cash line within half an hour. A few days later I was notified that I was one of the small prize winners in the Strathclyde University Staff Lottery. The prize was £57.";

var birthday = "The end of April is an expensive time for me: my mother's birthday is on the 28th, my wife's is on the 29th and my daughter's birthday is on the 30th.";

var worldWar = "The biggest coincidence I have experienced occurred when I was about 16 or 17 years of age.  I am now 73. On the evening that it occurred a teenage friend of mine and I planned to go out together, and we visited his sister’s house for the purpose, as I recall it, of enabling him to have a bath. While I was waiting for my friend I sat down in the lounge of his sister’s house and. to while the time away, began flicking through a publication that I think was entitled ‘A Pictorial History of the Second World War’* or something similar.  This publication comprised 10 or 12 red hard-covered volumes and was housed in a small wooden bookcase that had been purchased with the books.* I cannot remember whether I flicked through one volume of the publication only or more than one, but I came across a picture of a large landing craft on a Normandy beach from which, as I recall it, soldiers and vehicles were embarking.  The soldiers were dressed in full battle dress with foliage on their helmets, and I recognised one of them as the husband of my friend’s sister i.e. the person in whose house I was sitting. I immediately drew the photograph to the attention of the gentleman concerned and he confirmed that the photograph was indeed of him. I met my teenage friend recently and he informed me that, some years ago, his sister had recalled this incident and asked him if he knew the whereabouts of the volume containing her husband’s photograph and one day he had found it in his loft and returned it to her.  Whether she still has it or not I do not know, but she is still alive and kicking at 93 and I hope to find out. *The publication in question may have been Hutchinson’s Pictorial History of the War some of the editions of which was, I have ascertained from the internet, published in red volumes.";

var daveCarol = "I used to play golf with a chap called Dave whose long term partner's name was Carol. Dave's sister was also called Carol and her husband's name was David, whilst Carol's brother's name was David and he was married to a Carol too. MY David and Carol had two children and continued the family tradition by naming them Carol and David. I've lost contact with him now but last time I saw him the two teenagers were respectively engaged to a David and going out with a Carol. Family gatherings must have been very confusing.";

var peterJoan = "Whilst on Madeira in 1994 we with four others went on a Jeep Safari. One of the other couples were PETER and JOAN from Clitheroe in Lancashire. Joan worked at a doctors surgery. We got quite friendly with them. Fast forward to 2007. We are on holiday in Scotland and arrive in Oban from Mull looking for accommodation at the Tourist Information Office. They direct us to a guesthouse further inland which has only that week started taking visitors. That night we decide to dine in. At dinner we meet the only other guests a couple who are staying just the one night. We quickly discover that they are PETER and JOAN and that they come from Clitheroe in Lancashire. We start to relate our Madeira experience as a coincidence only to find that JOAN 2 is a friend of JOAN 1 and works in the same doctors surgery. Both couples had been firm firm friends for many years.";
